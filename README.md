Submitted by: **Nanki Sekhon**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Using American-specific currency 
* [ ] Visually pleasing UI
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Users can select between people splitting the bill by tapping the different values on the segmented control and the split value is then updated accordingly

## Notes

I ran into a number of technical issues. I had to make the Tip App twice because the first time, the Source Control Navigator showed me no libraries when I initially coded the app. But when I made another one through X Code, the libraries were found in Source Control Naviagtor. A smaller issue I ran into was having problem with the splitControl segmented control properly updating. I had to recreate a segment control.
